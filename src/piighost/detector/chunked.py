    """Wrapper that splits long texts into overlapping chunks before detection.

    When a text exceeds ``chunk_size`` characters, it is split into
    overlapping chunks and the inner detector is called on each chunk.
    Detection positions are adjusted back to original-text coordinates
    and deduplicated in overlap regions.

    For texts shorter than or equal to ``chunk_size``, the inner detector
    is called directly with no splitting overhead.

    Args:
        detector: The inner detector to wrap.
        chunk_size: Maximum number of characters per chunk.
        overlap: Number of overlapping characters between consecutive chunks.

        >>> from piighost.detector import ExactMatchDetector
        >>> inner = ExactMatchDetector([("Patrick", "PERSON")])
        >>> chunked = ChunkedDetector(detector=inner, chunk_size=50, overlap=10)
